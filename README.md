# syrup-orm

Syrup ORM is a Java library intended to provide Object Relational Mapping to Java Properties files

In its essence it should provide a means of interacting with Java Properties files using native Java idiosyncrasies that most developers should be accustomed to

Furthering the modus operandi of using an ORM for properties files, this library should provide a means of having an extremely lightweight, transparent flat-file database that requires no instantiation on the end-users perspective

This library is written with the Java Persistence API in mind, to facilitate a very low learning curve on creating interactions with properties files that make sense with relative ease
